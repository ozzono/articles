## Technical validation tool

### HackerRank and similar tools

Help evaluate the technical knowledge of programmers and software developers. Although most tests are exciting and challenging, both the type of problem and the time constraint do not match the daily reality of those working with programming and therefore do not adequately assess the candidate's skills.
It's common for these tools to have a strict time limitation present in most tests leading to a problem, as it may prevent the candidate from delivering the work and, consequently, does not allow for evaluating their performance. At least some platforms allow one to complete the tests within 24 hours, with a specific duration for each test. This approach provides greater flexibility and avoids continuous tests of 120 minutes, for example.

#### Pros

- Tests are usually quick;
- It may include database tests in addition to code and logic tests;

#### Cons

- There is a strict time limit, and some tests can add up to 180m;
- The test is limited, making it superficial and insufficient;
- The test is conducted online, which could be better;
- **Does not** assess skills used in the daily routine of most programmers or companies;

## An entire project shared through a Git repository

Also known only as a code challenge, it's a flexible way to evaluate candidates' technical knowledge. The technical team describes what should be developed, and the candidate shares the result using code versioning tools like Github. However, this comprehensive evaluation can be slow and take around a week. This approach can discourage candidates and generate workload, especially if they are in simultaneous recruitment processes. Additionally, the candidate may have developed something similar in a previous challenge, which can make the evaluation less effective. Therefore, checking the candidate's GitHub history before starting the process is recommended, as described here. Analyzing the repositories shared by the candidate can make the recruitment process much faster without giving up technical requirements.

#### Pros

- Huge flexibility;
- Ability to assess in-depth knowledge of only the topics of interest;

#### Cons

- Somewhat slow Assessment;
- Possible demotivation due to delay and a potential feeling of wasted time at the end of the evaluation;
- Possible overload on the candidate;
- The candidate may have already done something similar before and repeat and adapt;

## Live coding interview

A method of challenge in which the candidate is invited to write code with their evaluators. As the test is done, the evaluator asks critical questions to assess the candidate's knowledge and fluency in the technology. Interviews like this are quick and would be similar to a mix between a [Technical Interview](#technical-interview) and the kind of code considered in the [validation tools](#technical-validation-tool), given the complexity and time of the challenge. The live assessment can also help check the candidate's ability to communicate and work in a team and their ability to handle pressure and adaptability. However, the evaluator must have effective communication and feedback skills to avoid making the candidate feel uncomfortable or pressured. Additionally, it is recommended that the challenge be realistic and consistent with the daily work of a programmer to provide an accurate and fair assessment.
Because it is a limited-time option, it can also become inconsistent with the workday.

#### Pros

- Relatively short interview;
- Assesses the ability to handle pressure and adaptability;

#### Cons

- Due to the time constraint, it becomes difficult to address advanced technical aspects;
- Requires caution from the evaluator to avoid excessive pressure on the candidate;
- It may not make sense if pair programming is not part of the company's developers' daily routine;
- Generally, real tasks do not have a deadline in minutes or hours, making them more flexible than what is addressed in the test;

## Technical Interview

A direct interview with a person recognized by the company for having more experience and knowledge of technology and development. As a rule, it addresses the technologies and challenges that are part of the company's daily routine.

The technical interview is usually conducted by the so-called tech lead, a professional with more career time and experience in the technologies and problems that are part of the company's business. Unfortunately, this interview needs to be more objective and reflect the accurate level of knowledge and experience of the candidate, which can lead to hiring doomed to failure and frustration for all parties, as well as the early dismissal of a good candidate.

In turn, the interviewer has the opportunity to address challenges that are impossible to contemplate in a code challenge, such as concurrency, optimized use of resources, specific challenges of the company, and security under various aspects, among many others.

#### Pros

- It is typically short, lasting at most 1 hour;
- It allows the interviewer to ask questions that are usually not covered in code challenges;

#### Cons

- It depends on the subjective interpretation of the interviewer;

## Edit code in an existing project

Editing code that has already been started and is functional, implementing new business rules or features according to the description of the challenge.

In this format, the candidate receives a ready and active repository, and it is up to them to implement something new as requested. This challenge is the closest to the day-to-day development where it is necessary to navigate through legacy code and, more importantly, understand what is written and find a way to implement what is asked. If well-designed, there will be a need to understand various technologies and concepts such as git, databases, automated tests, or REST, as well as development paradigms such as MVC or maybe some design pattern.

This format would also be a hybrid between online [technical assessment tools](#technical-validation-tool) since it does not require building a project from scratch and [shared code challenge](#an-entire-project-shared-through-a-git-repository) since it is close to the day-to-day of the company. It, therefore, encompasses the advantages of both approaches.

Because it is the most directed type of validation, it requires care to prevent it from becoming a superficial test.

#### Pros

- The challenge is usually quick, lasting on average 1 hour;
- Opportunity to evaluate essential related knowledge such as git, databases, REST, MVC, design patterns, and automated tests;
- Assesses the ability to understand legacy code and implement new features;

#### Cons

- Too directed tests and may be superficial

## Assessment of public repositories

Access and evaluate public repositories written and maintained by the candidate to gauge their knowledge depth. In this format, the candidate does not do anything, as supposedly everything is already done in projects they have worked on and made public on their profile on platforms such as GitHub. It is, therefore, up to a tech lead to read the code and validate that the candidate has the necessary knowledge. The result is similar to the [code challenge](#an-entire-project-shared-through-a-git-repository), as it can be precisely a project derived from a previous challenge.
If it is needed to gauge any additional skills or knowledge, a targeted test can be done on the specific topic.

#### Pros

- Assessment without candidate effort required;
- If necessary, allows for the evaluation of specific skills or knowledge only;
- Quick assessment;

#### Cons

##### (Yeah, no cons, as far as I know)

## To recruiters

A poor performance in a validation test, especially the more superficial ones, does not mean that the candidate lacks sufficient skills or knowledge. Today, there are many ways to solve complex problems thanks to the abundance of available consolidated and shared knowledge sources. Therefore, software developers need to know how to ask the right question to find the best answer, making it unnecessary to have everything at their fingertips. Moreover, it is essential to understand what requirements are indeed crucial for the job and which are secondary.
To recruiters and tech leads who participate in selection processes, an invitation is extended to include, in addition to applying any of the technical validation formats, also feedback for the candidate to be able to, if applicable, know their own mistakes and also better prepare for the following opportunities that arise. Even the most simple notes taken during the technical interview are helpful.

## Opinion

As I have already been submitted to all these types of assessments, I believe that the best way to assess the knowledge of a software developer consists the sum of a technical test followed by a technical interview so that it is possible to determine both fluency in the language in which intends to work on understanding the most common challenges when maintaining a code with high complexity and demand, as well as allowing the review of the submitted code to know how the candidate reasons and solves problems.

I would choose repository [editing with legacy code](#edit-code-in-an-existing-project) or [Assessment of public shared repositories](#an-entire-project-shared-through-a-git-repository) maintained by the candidate, followed by a technical interview with one or more tech leads. Submitting to a code challenge with a project combined with a [technical interview](#technical-interview) focused on commenting on the shared code also allows you to understand how much the candidate understands about the code he wrote and alternatives to what was presented.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

Following technological innovations, linguistic AI emerged, like ChatGPT, which suggests valid code from a simple description and complete code if the request is comprehensive and well made. Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent its use in conjunction with any of the types of technical validation mentioned so far. Therefore, more than ever, technical assessments need to consider the existence and use of these new tools, as [ChatGPT now has sufficient training to be approved in the Googles recruitment process](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary).
In other words, this article will age fast, and technical validations and processes that do not modernize will age along with it.
