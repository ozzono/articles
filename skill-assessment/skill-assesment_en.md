# Criticism and commentary on technical validation during the recruitment

In this comment, I will deal with the most common ways of validating the knowledge and technical skill of programmers and software developers in general.

Content considered in this article
Forms of technical validation:
Online technical assessment tools: hackerrank and others;
Full project shared with Git repository;
Live coding - pair programming
Technical Interview
Add code to started project

To recruiters
HackerRank and the like
They are market tools dedicated to developing code tests in order to assess the degree of knowledge of different technologies, including the most used today.
Tools like HackerRank are interesting and have their space. They fail to apply a very strict time limit, which can even prevent the candidate from even delivering the job, implying a lack of performance, which is the worst case scenario for everyone. I recently came into contact with a tool of this category that allows you to complete the tests within 24 hours and each test has its own duration. This facility allows you to carry out all the tests with greater freedom and avoids the existence of tests that add up to 120m continuous, for example.

Pros Cons
Tests are usually quick; It has a strict time limitation and some tests add up to 180 minutes.
Includes database tests in addition to code and logic tests; The test is limited, making it superficial and insufficient;
The test is carried out via the web, which is very bad;
Legendary in delivering the result, depending on the platform.

Full project shared with Git repository
It is usually called a code challenge where the technical team details what needs to be developed and, as a rule, is shared back using code versioning tools such as Github.
This type of challenge has enormous flexibility and allows for checking the degree of knowledge of the exact topics of interest. Among the disadvantages of this type of assessment is the fact that they are usually slow, taking an average of a week, which not only can discourage the candidate but can also potentially leave the feeling of wasted time. The effort of this type of evaluation can also generate overload in the candidate's workload, especially if they are recruiting simultaneously.
Also consider that the candidate may have already developed something similar to what will be required in this new process in a previous challenge, that is, he will just rewrite and adapt the necessary parts to meet the description. In that case it's worth looking at Github first, as described here.

Pros Cons
Huge flexibility; Slow evaluation;
Possibility to measure in-depth knowledge only of the topics of interest; Possible discouragement due to delay;
Possible feeling of wasted time at the end of the assessment;
Possible candidate overload;
Possibility of the candidate having already done something similar before and just repeating and adapting.

Live coding (live coding)
Challenge modality in which the candidate is invited to write code together with his evaluators and as the test is carried out, the evaluator asks key questions to assess the candidate's degree of knowledge in addition to his fluency in the technology in question.
Interviews like this are usually quick and would be something similar to a mix between the Technical Interview and the complete Project, with the exceptions of complexity and time of the challenge.
It is important to carefully observe how the evaluator behaves. Given the situation, it is very easy for the candidate to feel pressured and cornered, a problem that can also occur during the technical interview.
This is a time to assess knowledge and not to carry out a police investigation due to a serious crime committed.

Pros Cons
Relatively short interview Given the limited time, it becomes difficult to address advanced technical aspects;
It requires caution to avoid putting too much pressure on the candidate.

Technical Interview
Direct interview with a person recognized by the company for having more experience and knowledge of technology and development. As a rule, it addresses the technologies and challenges that are part of the company's day-to-day.
The technical interview is usually carried out by the so-called tech lead, a professional with a longer career and experience in the technologies and problems that are part of the company's business. Unfortunately, this interview is too subjective and does not necessarily reflect the true degree of knowledge and experience of the candidate, which ends up making possible a hiring that is doomed to failure and to the frustration of all parties.
In turn, the interviewer has the opportunity to address challenges that are impossible to contemplate in a code challenge, such as
